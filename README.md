# Nativescript + Amplify

This repo attemps to show a demonstration of combining the power of NativeScript and AWS for the next generation of cross-platform mobile apps.

This repo contains a hello world application that tries to read and write a string (`hello world`) from the phone local storage, using AWS Amplify utilities for both iOS and Android, using NativeScript.

## How was this done?

This repository is nothing but the result of initializing a [NativeScript Angular App](https://docs.nativescript.org/angular/start/cli-basics#creating-applications), and following the [AWS Amplify for Angular installation documentation](https://docs.amplify.aws/start/getting-started/installation/q/integration/angular#option-1-watch-the-video-guide).
